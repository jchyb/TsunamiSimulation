# Tsunami Simulation
Created during a Scala university course in a team of two, mostly to practice and deepen understanding of the language. 
Simulated (two-dimensional) field consists of discretized water, wavebrakers, wind and linearly rising beach. Contains simple (java swing based) visualisations.
Essentially unrealistic, but with somewhat convincing results.
