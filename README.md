# Tsunami Simulation
Created during a Scala university course in a team of two, mostly to practice and deepen understanding of the language. 
Simulated field consists of discretisied water, wavebrakers, wind and linearly rising beach. Contains simple (java swing based) visualisations.
Essentially unrealistic, but with somewhat convincing results.
